# 🐝 Integration Bee

**An AI-powered calculus integration game that makes learning fun and interactive!**

## 🎯 Project Description

Integration Bee transforms calculus integration practice into an engaging game experience, similar to chess.com's puzzle rush. Students solve integration problems by drawing their solutions on an interactive canvas, which are then validated by AI using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎮 **Game Modes**: 3-minute, 5-minute, and unlimited time challenges
- ✏️ **Interactive Canvas**: Draw solutions by hand with pen/eraser tools
- 🤖 **AI Validation**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision validates handwritten solutions
- 📈 **Progressive Difficulty**: Basic → Intermediate → Advanced levels
- 🔥 **Streak System**: Build solving streaks for motivation
- 💡 **Hint System**: Get helpful tips when stuck
- 📊 **Statistics**: Track performance, accuracy, and progress
- 📚 **Practice Mode**: Study without time pressure
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Modern design with LaTeX math rendering

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
- **Math Rendering**: KaTeX
- **Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key
- npm/pnpm/yarn

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. **Set up environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. **Add your OpenAI API key** to `.env.local`
5. **Run development server**: `npm run dev`
6. **Open**: http://localhost:3000

## 🎲 How to Play

1. Choose your game mode (3min/5min/unlimited)
2. Solve integration problems by drawing on the canvas
3. Submit your handwritten solution for AI validation
4. Progress through difficulty levels
5. Build streaks and track your improvement!
